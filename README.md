# misc
Miscellaneous tools and scripts, mostly one-offs that may not be maintained.

# What can be found here?

As the title somewhat suggests this is a collection of various scripts and tools
that I've written and decided to open-source. Most of these are just simple
one-offs or PoC's that I've written for some particular purpose. Most of these
are rather old and may require some patching or considerable rewrite to work.

So be warned... and especially if the scripts are written in Perl, that means
they are from 2011 or earlier, probably even from prior to 2009... so they may
not work anymore or only work on parsing old file formats.
