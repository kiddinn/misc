# misc
Miscellaneous tools and scripts, mostly one-offs that may not be maintained.

# WARNING !

This is a repository for legacy scripts, just to have a single location for all
of them, it is not meant as a repository for anything really super useful, at least
not to the masses, although some may find some of these scripts at least semi-useful.

Do not rely on anything found here.... consider this a friendly warning...

# What can be found here?

As the title somewhat suggests this is a collection of various scripts and tools
that I've written and decided to open-source. Most of these are just simple
one-offs or PoC's that I've written for some particular purpose. Most of these
are rather old and may require some patching or considerable rewrite to work.

So be warned... and especially if the scripts are written in Perl, that means
they are from 2011 or earlier, probably even from prior to 2009... so they may
not work anymore or only work on parsing old file formats.

# Yet another disclaimer

Most of these scripts were written way before I actually knew how to write scripts
at all, mostly meant as a one-off exercise or playing with coding... and I choose
Perl cause that was a thing I did back in the good ol' times. None of these scripts
have gone through any real QA, nor are they particularly well written, since they
were used by me to learn how to write code... since then I've actually learned about
software development and switched all my focus on writing code for my other actually
maintained projects.
