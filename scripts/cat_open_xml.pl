# This script reads a document that is written in the OpenXML format, such
# as Microsoft Office documents and displays the content of that file, much
# like the antiword does for the older Microsoft Word format.
#
# See further information about the structure here:
# 	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa338205.aspx
#
# This script requires both Archive::Zip and LibXML, 
# to install the dependencies using Ubuntu, issue the following commands:
# 	apt-get install libarchive-any-perl
# 	apt-get install libxml-libxml-perl
#
# According to the standard OpenXML documents are compressed using ZIP
# and therefore it is required to unzip the documents before parsing
# the content
# The content is then stored in a XML documents.  The file
# _rels/.rels defines the relationships that the document contains
# and therefore it should be the first file that is to be read.
# From there you can find any additional files that contain content 
#	DOC.ENDING/word/document.xml
#
# This script will read the _rels/.rels file, parse it's input, search
# for any XML file that contains text information of the file and 
# then parse that document and print out the content found
# in it.
#
# Usage:
#	cat_open_xml.pl DOCUMENT.ENDING
# Example:
#	cat_open_xml.pl readme.docx
